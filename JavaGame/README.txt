My first java project, just a simplistic minesweeper-like game.
Everything was coded in java using jframe on Intellij, and I coded this whilst taking my Java class 
(CS211) in school. All other assets were made using microsoft paint.

Run the jar file to start the game.

There is still one bug, in which sometimes the background music will still continue to play after game close.
Another problem is that for some reason the score text inside the score board is slightly out of place, however
when I run the program on intellij it is normal.
